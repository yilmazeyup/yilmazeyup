👋Hi.
💞️As a full-stack developer, I have realized many projects. In general, these projects were related to finance processes, budget planning and statistical operations. 
I usually wrote these projects on the Web.
In parallel with this, I developed myself in the field of management processes for several years. 
🌱Between 2013-2018, I worked as a finance and accounting consultant in various sectors. In these studies, 
I used data mining and business intelligence products as a method. Thus, I gained experience in big data and data processing. 
After these experiences, I reached a position where I could evaluate the results and solve process problems.


📫I'm doing integration projects on Twilio.
📫📫I frequently use Devextreme processes in the frontend.
📫📫📫In the backend part, I am writing Asp.Net projects in c#.

👀My aim is to make a system that carries out the budget, accounting and finance processes on the web completely automatically. 
At the moment, I think I have completed 3/7 of this purpose.
